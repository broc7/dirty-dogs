## Notes:

Using Bootstrap 4 for the CSS framework as the design seemed close to that already.

Using Google Fonts for Open Sans.

I added some responsiveness, mobile first, since Bootstrap has that readily available. The desktop version will match the design very closely, but there was no spec for smaller devices of course.
